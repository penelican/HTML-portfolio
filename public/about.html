<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I recently accomplished the task of completing five decades of living on this planet.  I have enjoyed learning about it
  and about myself and my nature.  I have found that I am a curious character with many varied interests.  While I have been 
  aware of these interests for a long time, I haven't always openly shared them with others.  In the last few years I have
  started opening up and sharing my true self more frequently with the world, and this project is an additional piece of
  that growth.</p>

<p>One of the interests I have is working with Tarot and Oracle cards.  If you would like to see what kinds of work I do 
  with them and some of my other hobbies, you can check out my website at <a href="https://www.oraclegrove.com">Oracle Grove.</a>
</p>

<p>Oracle Grove was built using WordPress which I am learning more about as well, but this portfolio project is currently being 
  built with HTML only.  I soon hope to learn more about CSS and JavaScript and my goal is to become a full-stack developer within 
  the year.
